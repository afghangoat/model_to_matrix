# JS model to matrix

A script which helped me "matrixify" 3D models to train my own 3D model generator AI.

## Requirements

The script requires Three JS.

## Usage

First, tweak the script to load the model you want. Next, open the page and copy the json format generated from the matrix (check the dev console on Chrome).
This format only keeps the vertex data so it is more lightweight for training AI.
